		NUM_CODING_FILES refers to the number of files whose loss can be tolerated by the decoder.

============
== MERKLE ==
============

* bitcoin/src/primitives/block.cpp
-----------------------------------

	*BuildMerkleTree
		- transactions should be in vector vtx.
		- returns merkle root.

	*GetMerkleBranch
		- input index of transaction
		- returns merkle proof (pi) i.e vector of hashes using which merkle root can be 
		  computed.

	*CheckMerkleBranch
		- input hash of indexed transaction, merkle proof, index of hashed transaction
		- returns (supposed) merkle root, reconstructed using the current hash and the 
		  merkle proof.
		- returned value can be compared with actual merkle root.


=========
== POW ==
=========

* bitcoin/src/miner.cpp
-----------------------------------

	*ScanHash
		- Hashes nearly all the details of a CBlockHeader (including the MerkleRootHash, but NOT the 
		  nonce).
		- Takes a nonce in a while loop, increments it, keeps adding it to the hash to see if any 
		  initial zero bits emerge.

	*BitCoinMiner
		- Does the mining.
		- If ScanHash returns a hash with some initial zero bits, checks to see if it is less than "Z".
		- "Z" is denoted by "arith_uint256().SetCompact(pblock->nBits)", where nBits represents the 
		  difficulty of the puzzle.
		- If a successful solution is found, ProcessBlockFound is called.

	*IncrementExtraNonce
		- Apart from other things, it calls BuildMerkleTree().

	*CreateNewBlockWithKey
		- Calls CreateNewBlock().

	*CreateNewBlock
		- Creates a block from all the transactions.
